# About me

Hi!

I'm Marcos Gil, a web developer based in Madrid.

I'm working as a Software Engineer at IKEA.

In my previous experience I worked as a frontend developer at ING  🦁.

Where we were working closely with web standards, HTML, CSS and lots of javascript! We were not using frameworks, just **web components** on top of a set of common libraries:

lit-html < lit-element < lion < ing-web

I like to contribute to open-source projects to be updated in the latest technologies!

Out of work I am a sports lover, I play football in my town team Galapagar but now with the COVID situation we cannot play so I am trying new things like Crossfit, running or mountain bike!
