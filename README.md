Welcome to my personal blog! This is where I share my thoughts, experiences, and insights on various topics. Feel free to explore the different articles and engage in discussions.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside the project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

## ðŸ”§ CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes comprehensive CI/CD workflows:

- **PR Validation**: Runs linting, dependency checks, unit tests, and build verification
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Automated visual testing across multiple browsers
- **Security Scanning**: Weekly dependency vulnerability scans and security audits
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Ensures compatibility across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari

### Visual Testing

The project uses Playwright for visual regression testing to ensure UI consistency:

- Tests run automatically on pull requests affecting UI code
- Snapshots are captured across different browsers and viewport sizes
- Failed visual tests provide detailed comparison reports
- Manual snapshot updates available through GitHub Actions workflow
