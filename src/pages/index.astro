      <h1>Hola! I'm Marcos Gil</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my personal space on the internet.</p>
      <p>
        I'm a Senior Software Engineer based in Madrid, Spain, currently working at <a
          href="https://www.IKEA.com/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >IKEA</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here I share practical notes, learnings, and experiments from my transition toward an AI Engineer profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current starting domain is AI Agents: tool-using systems, evaluation, reliability, and secure automation.
        I work iteratively and focus on small, concrete artifacts each session.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nanobot is my active starting platform due to its low learning curve and deployability, and I progressively
        expand the roadmap toward OpenClaw, AgentZero, and OpenCode.
      </p>
      <p>Now that you are here, you can learn more about me in:</p>
