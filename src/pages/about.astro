  <p>
    Senior Software Engineer with over a decade of experience building production-grade web applications.
    I bring a strong foundation in systems thinking, engineering rigor, and cross-layer understanding
    spanning frontend, backend, DevOps, and quality engineering.
  </p>

  <h2>Current Focus: Applied AI Engineering</h2>
  <p>
    I'm actively transitioning into <strong>Applied AI Engineering</strong>, focusing on building
    production-grade AI agents and automation systems. My interests include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>AI Agent Systems</strong> — Tool-using agents with loops, memory, and measurable evaluation</li>
    <li><strong>Skills Libraries</strong> — Modular, composable primitives that teams can assemble into workflows</li>
    <li><strong>Agent Reliability</strong> — Observability, tracing, retries, and regression testing for agentic systems</li>
    <li><strong>Workflow Automation</strong> — Autonomous workflows for business operations with human-in-the-loop patterns</li>
    <li><strong>AI Development Environments</strong> — Templates, patterns, and documentation that enable teams to ship AI-powered features</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I approach AI engineering with the same production mindset I bring to traditional software:
    if it can't be evaluated and reproduced, it's not done.
  </p>
