    In my previous experience, I have worked as a frontend developer for ING ü¶Å in the offices of
    Las Rozas, Madrid. The project was called ING Model Bank where work was done on a new
    multi-country banking platform that would allow its use in all the countries of the ING Group.
    For this, cutting-edge technologies based on web standards, Polymer, Web Components, ES6, CSS
    Custom Properties, CSS Grid, among others, were used. For more information, go to the projects
    section.

    In previous projects I have played other fullstack technologies such as the Front Backbone and
    Marionette, JQuery (JavaScript), Stylus (CSS) or Gulp; in the REST back API with Spring MVC,
    JSF, Facelets, JSTL (Java), JBoss, (Eclipse, STS), MySQL (PL / SQL), under agile methodologies
    and BBD (Concordion and Selenium). Before that, I did a training internship with JavaScript
    technologies like the MEAN Stack (Mongo DB, Express, Angular JS and Node JS) and Polymer in
    Babel.
