          <p>
            Senior Software Engineer with over a decade of experience building production-grade web applications.
            I bring a strong foundation in systems thinking, engineering rigor, and cross-layer understanding
            spanning frontend, backend, DevOps, and quality engineering.
          </p>

          <h2>Current Focus: AI Engineer Path</h2>
          <p>
            I'm actively evolving toward an <strong>AI Engineer</strong> profile. AI Agents are my initial
            specialization domain because they combine runtime engineering, tool orchestration, evaluation,
            automation, and operational rigor.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>AI Agent Systems</strong> — Tool-using agents with explicit loops, memory boundaries,
              and termination criteria
            </li>
            <li><strong>Evaluation & Regression</strong> — Repeatable benchmarks, failure analysis, and behavior comparisons</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Agent Operations</strong> — Threat-model-first design, deny-by-default access, and auditability</li>
            <li><strong>Async/Background Workflows</strong> — Long-running automations with run artifacts and clear status</li>
            <li><strong>Cost & Context Quality</strong> — Model routing, caching, and memory/context discipline</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I work iteratively in the free slots available each day. The rule is simple:
            finish each work session with one concrete artifact (code, test, run report, or documentation)
            and one clearly defined next step.
          </p>

          <h2>Current Starting Platform: Nanobot</h2>
          <p>
            Nanobot is my active starting platform because it has a low learning curve and immediate
            deployability for real-world workflows. It is a launchpad, not the final boundary of my roadmap.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure & Deploy</strong> — Terraform + VPS operations and deployment automation</li>
            <li><strong>LLM Router</strong> — Tiered model routing, budget control, and usage visibility</li>
            <li><strong>Memory Manager</strong> — Persistent context and memory lifecycle management</li>
            <li><strong>Gym Booker</strong> — Real automation use case with reliability and operations constraints</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Platform Progression</strong> — Expand next into OpenClaw, AgentZero hardening patterns,
              and OpenCode async operations
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            My operating standard is production-minded AI engineering: if behavior cannot be measured,
            replayed, and explained, it's not done.
          </p>
