  <p>Happy to see you in this section! 👋</p>
  <p>
    I’m a web developer advocate with a fiery passion for all things tech. Whether it’s the latest
    software trends, UX/UI magic, accessibility wizardry, or QA sorcery, I’m all ears! 🌟
  </p>
  <h2>My Mission 🎯</h2>
  <p>
    Every day, I wake up with one goal: to create a digital symphony that resonates across the web.
    My secret sauce? A versatile and resilient profile that dances between code and creativity. 🎶
  </p>

  <h2>Where I Hang My Code Hat 🏠</h2>
  <p>
    Currently, I’m weaving digital dreams as a Software Engineer at IKEA. Specifically, I groove in
    the Digital Hub nestled in sunny San Sebastián de los Reyes, Madrid. We call it “Madhult,” and
    it’s where these IKEA’s digital developments happens:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>IKEA for Business</li>
    <li>IKEA Physical Meeting Points</li>
    <li>IKEA Food</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>IKEA for Business 🛒</h2>
  <p>
    My job? To untangle the digital knots for our business-savvy clients. From unraveling UX
    mysteries to sprinkling React spells, I’m here to make their buying journey a breeze. 💼
  </p>

  <h3>My Tech Toolbox 🛠️</h3>
  <p>When I’m not sipping virtual coffee, you’ll find me juggling an array of tech goodies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>React: My trusty sidekick for crafting pixel-perfect experiences.</li>
    <li>Sass: Because plain CSS is so last season.</li>
    <li>Vitest and Jest: My testing buddies—always keeping me on my toes.</li>
    <li>Vite and Webpack: The dynamic duo behind lightning-fast builds.</li>
    <li>Storybook: Where UI components come alive.</li>
    <li>Eslint, Prettier, Husky: My code quality guardians.</li>
    <li>Node JS: My backstage pass to server-side magic.</li>
    <li>Express: For those smooth API vibes.</li>
    <li>Javascript and Typescript: My dynamic duo for scripting adventures.</li>
    <li>Git and Github: Where version control meets collaboration.</li>
    <li>CI/CD, Github Actions: Because automated pipelines are my jam.</li>
    <li>Infrastructure as Code with Terraform: Building castles in the cloud.</li>
    <li>GCP: My playground for scaling dreams.</li>
    <li>
      Agile Methodologies: Because life’s too short for waterfall. Sometime Kanban others Sprints,
      you name it.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Flashback: ING Days 🦁</h2>
  <p>
    Before my IKEA escapades, I was a frontend wizard at ING. Picture this: a multi-country banking
    platform, powered by cutting-edge tech. Web standards, Polymer, Web Components, ES6, CSS Custom
    Properties, and CSS Grid—we threw them all into the cauldron. The result? A digital potion that
    worked seamlessly across ING Group countries. 🌐
  </p>

  <h2>Beginnings in Babel 📳</h2>
  <p>In the past, I’ve donned various hats:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Front Backbone and Marionette: My fullstack tango partners.</li>
    <li>JQuery: My trusty sidekick in the JavaScript wild west.</li>
    <li>Stylus: Because styles deserve some love too.</li>
    <li>Gulp: My gulp of productivity.</li>
    <li>REST APIs with Spring MVC, JSF, Facelets, JSTL: Where Java met my backend soul.</li>
    <li>JBoss, Eclipse, STS: My command center.</li>
    <li>MySQL (PL / SQL): Where data danced to my queries.</li>
    <li>Agile and BBD (Concordion and Selenium): My secret weapons.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Prelude 🎶</h2>
  <p>
    I completed my Degree in Industrial Technology Engineering with focus in automation and
    electronics in Universidad Politécnica de MadridUniversidad Politécnica of Madrid.
  </p>
  <p>But Software is my thing so I looked for something to start in this sector.</p>
  <p>Babel brought the opportunity to transition.</p>
  <p>And I have never looked back. ✨</p>
  <p>Thanks to get to this point!🥰</p>
